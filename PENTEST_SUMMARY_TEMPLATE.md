# Penetration Test - Executive Summary (Redacted Template)

> **Note for Enterprise Procurement:** This document is a public, redacted template of our annual third-party Penetration Test Executive Summary. The full, unredacted report containing specific vulnerability vectors, CVSS scores, and remediation evidence is strictly available under a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (MNDA).

## 1. Engagement Overview
* **Assessment Type:** Grey-Box Web API Penetration Test & Cloud Infrastructure Review.
* **Target Scope:** LumaTrace Cloud API (`api.lumatrace.es`), Authentication flows, and Tenant Isolation mechanisms.
* **Methodology:** OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks (2023), NIST SP 800-115.
* **Testing Frequency:** Bi-Annually.

## 2. Objective
To identify vulnerabilities in the LumaTrace API boundary that could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, breach tenant isolation, exfiltrate C2PA metadata, or manipulate the spatial watermarking injection process.

## 3. High-Level Findings (Status: REMEDIATED)
During the most recent engagement, the testing team identified **[REDACTED]** vulnerabilities:
* **Critical (CVSS 9.0 - 10.0):** 0
* **High (CVSS 7.0 - 8.9):** 0
* **Medium (CVSS 4.0 - 6.9):** [REDACTED] - *Resolved within SLA.*
* **Low (CVSS 0.1 - 3.9):** [REDACTED] - *Resolved within SLA.*

## 4. Key Security Validations
The third-party auditors successfully validated the following security claims:
**Tenant Isolation:** Cryptographic boundaries preventing Cross-Tenant Data Access hold strong.
**Rate Limiting:** Token-bucket API quotas effectively mitigate Layer 7 DoS attempts.
**Zero-Retention:** Ephemeral processing pipelines correctly wipe asset buffers from memory post-injection.

## 5. Attestation
The testing firm confirms that all findings with a CVSS score > 4.0 have been successfully remediated and re-tested.
